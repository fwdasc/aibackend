1 Compliance Guidelines
  1a Issuing and Sales Presentation of Life Insurance Policies and Conducts of Life Insurance Agents, Life Insurance Brokers, and Banks 
  1b Do not use wording that might cause a misunderstanding that it is a “deposit” instead of “insurance premium payment” or any other words that may cause the customer to understand it is a deposit. If using the word "saving," it must be clearly identified as "life insurance saving."

2 Suitability:
  2a Ensure the customer receives correct and adequate information when deciding to enter into an insurance contract. The product must suit the customer's needs, risks, and payment capability. If the product does not meet these criteria, the offeror must inform the customer immediately and suggest more suitable alternatives.

3 Premium Payment Information:
  3a Inform the customer about premium payment details such as the amount, insurance period, payment period, and obligations to continuously pay premiums. Also, inform about the effects of not paying premiums continuously.
  3b If the product is offered with another financial product, inform the insurance premium separately from other expenses for comparison. Ensure the customer is aware that a life insurance policy has been purchased.

4 Customer Rights:
  4a Inform the customer about necessary rights after purchasing an insurance product, such as the “free look” period, the right to surrender or cancel the policy, claim rights, and the claim process.

5 Required Dialogue Details:
  5a Summary of conditions, protections, benefits, and exclusions in the life insurance policy.
  5b The amount of premiums, the duration of insurance protection, the starting date of protection, and the duration of premium payment.
  5c The right to cancel the policy within 30 days or more after receiving the policy, depending on the type of insurance plan offered, with a full refund of premiums.
  5d Company’s name and contact phone number. If conducted by a broker or bank, the name of that entity must be notified.

Non-Compliant Conversations:
6 Overstating policy benefits.
  6a Imitating and comparing investment return with fixed deposits. 
  6b Comparing product benefits with other products.
  6c Failing to inform that the customer is buying a new policy.
  6d Implying the endowment product is a saving/deposit product.
  6e Providing incorrect product conditions.
